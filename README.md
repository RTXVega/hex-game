# Hex AI – Minimax & Alpha-Beta (Python)

## Project Overview

This project implements the board game **Hex** with multiple AI difficulty levels based on:

- Minimax search
- Alpha-Beta pruning
- Different evaluation functions
- Tournament-based performance analysis

The goal is to study the impact of search depth and heuristic evaluation on AI performance.

## Game Description

Hex is a deterministic, two-player, zero-sum game played on an N×N hexagonal grid.

- Player 1 (Red) aims to connect the top and bottom sides.
- Player 2 (Blue) aims to connect the left and right sides.
- Players alternate placing stones on empty cells.
- There are no draws.

## AI Levels

Three AI difficulty levels are implemented:

- **Easy** – shallow search depth with a simple evaluation function  
- **Medium** – deeper search with improved heuristic  
- **Hard** – Alpha-Beta pruning with advanced evaluation and move ordering  

Each level differs in search depth, heuristic quality, and pruning efficiency.
